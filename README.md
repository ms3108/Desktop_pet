## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Voice recognition not working:**

#### Quick Fixes
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted to the application
- Check that your default microphone is working in other applications
- Try running the application as administrator
- Restart the application after connecting/changing microphones

#### Windows-Specific Issues
- **PyAudio Installation**: Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable if you get PyAudio errors
- **Microphone Privacy**: Go to Settings > Privacy > Microphone and enable microphone access
- **Default Device**: Set your preferred microphone as the default recording device in Sound settings

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Linux**: Install `portaudio19-dev` and `python3-pyaudio` packages
- **macOS**: Install PyAudio with `brew install portaudio` then `pip install pyaudio`
- **Virtual Environments**: Ensure PyAudio is installed in the correct Python environment

#### Voice Configuration Troubleshooting
If voice input is inconsistent, try adjusting these settings in `config.json`:

```json
{
    "voice_enabled": true,
    "energy_threshold": 4000,          // Higher = less sensitive (try 1000-4000)
    "dynamic_energy_threshold": false, // Disable auto-adjustment
    "microphone_timeout": 10,          // Longer timeout for slower systems
    "pause_threshold": 1.2             // Longer pause detection
}
```

#### Testing Voice Input
The application will show these status messages:
- `üé§ Testing microphone...` - Initial microphone test
- `‚úÖ Microphone test successful` - Voice input should work
- `‚ùå Microphone test failed` - Check microphone setup
- `üîá Voice input disabled` - Check `voice_enabled` in config
- `üéôÔ∏è Listening for voice commands...` - Ready for voice input
- `üó£Ô∏è Heard: 'your command'` - Successfully recognized speech

#### Advanced Troubleshooting
- **Multiple Microphones**: The app uses the system default - change it in system settings
- **USB Microphones**: Unplug and reconnect, then restart the application
- **Bluetooth Headsets**: Ensure they're connected in "Headset" mode, not just "Audio"
- **Background Noise**: Try using the app in a quieter environment first
- **Internet Connection**: Voice recognition requires internet for Google Speech API

**Clipboard commands not responding:**
- Verify clipboard contains text (not images/files)
- Try copying text again before voice command
- Check if clipboard access is blocked by security software

**Spotify integration not working:**
- Verify Spotify is running and playing music
- Check API credentials in `config.json`
- Ensure Spotify app is authorized

**Pet not appearing:**
- Check if running in fullscreen mode
- Verify all asset files are present
- Try running from command line to see error messages

**High CPU usage:**
- Voice recognition runs continuously - this is normal
- Close other audio applications if needed
- Consider adjusting recognition sensitivity
